<h1>Based on the example from the previous lesson, you can work directly in the browser or create separate HTML/JavaScript files â€“ choose a more convenient option.</h1>
 
<h2>Task 1: Pure Function Practice</h2>

<p>Write a pure function named calculateArea that takes two arguments, length, and width, and returns the area of a rectangle. Explain why your function is considered pure.</p>

<h2>Task 2: Scope Experiment</h2>

<p>Create a JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates the difference between global, local and block scopes. Declare variables in each scope, and try to access them from different parts of the code. Explain your observations.
</p>

<h2>Task 3: Closure Challenge</h2>

<p>Write a function createCounter that returns an object with two methods: increment and getValue. The increment method should increase a counter variable by 1, and getValue should return the current value of the counter. Ensure that the counter variable is encapsulated within the closure.
</p>

<h2>Task 4: Arrow Function Conversion</h2>

<p>Take a regular function declaration (e.g., function add(a, b) { return a + b; }) and convert it into an arrow function. Explain the differences in syntax and behavior between the two forms.</p>

<h2>Task 5: Practical Function Application</h2>

<p>Choose a real-world scenario (e.g., calculating shopping cart totals, filtering a list of items) and write a JavaScript function to solve the problem. Apply the concepts of parameters, return values, and potentially closures if needed.</p>
